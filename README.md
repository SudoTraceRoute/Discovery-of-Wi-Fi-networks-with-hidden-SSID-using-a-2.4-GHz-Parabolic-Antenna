# Discovery-of-Wi-Fi-networks-with-hidden-SSID-using-a-2.4-GHz-Parabolic-Antenna
This project demonstrates how a high-gain **directional antenna** can be used to discover Wi-Fi networks, including those with **hidden SSIDs** (networks that do not broadcast their name).  


It builds upon my earlier repositories:  
- 3D-Printed Modular Parabolic Dish Antenna  https://github.com/SudoTraceRoute/2.4GHz-Modular-Parabolic-Dish-Antenna
- 2D Wi-Fi Radar Mapping  https://github.com/SudoTraceRoute/wifi-radar-mapping  

The objective is to study **signal propagation, network visibility, and antenna directivity** while demonstrating that ‚Äúhiding a network name‚Äù is not an effective security measure.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational and research purposes only**. All measurements were made in a controlled environment using my own equipment. Unauthorized access to networks is illegal.

**üõ†Ô∏è Hardware and Software**

- **Antenna**: 3D-printed parabolic dish antenna for 2.4 GHz band (link to repo above).  
- **Wi-Fi Adapter**: *WiFi Nation WN-H3* (supports monitor mode and packet injection).  
- **Operating System**: Parrot OS (Debian-based, penetration testing distribution).  
- **Software Tools**:  
  - [Aircrack-ng suite](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) (scanning & monitoring)  
  - CSV log exports for analysis  
  - Standard Linux networking tools (`iwconfig`, `ifconfig`, `nmcli`)  

This setup was chosen because it reflects the type of hardware and tools that a network administrator or penetration tester would realistically use in troubleshooting or research.

**üì° Key Terminology**

- **SSID (Service Set Identifier):** The public name of a Wi-Fi network (e.g., `HomeWiFi`). A hidden SSID simply suppresses this broadcast but does not make the network secure.  
- **BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier):** The MAC address of a Wi-Fi access point. This uniquely identifies the device, even if the SSID is hidden.  
- **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator):** A measure of signal strength, reported in dBm (closer to 0 = stronger).  
- **Hidden SSID:** A Wi-Fi network that does not broadcast its SSID. While invisible to basic scans, it is still detectable by analyzing beacon and probe frames.  
- **Monitor Mode:** A special mode for Wi-Fi adapters that allows passive listening to all nearby traffic, not just connected networks.

**üîß Methodology**

1. Assembled the **directional antenna** and connected it to the Wi-Fi adapter.  
2. Performed a **0¬∞ ‚Üí 180¬∞ directional sweep**, moving in 15¬∞ increments.  
3. At each position:  
   - Captured nearby networks with `airodump-ng`.  
   - Logged visible and hidden SSIDs, BSSIDs, channels, encryption type, and RSSI values.  
4. Exported results to `.csv` format for later analysis.  
5. Generated a **radar-style visualization** to compare visible and hidden networks across antenna angles.  

This experiment highlights how antenna orientation strongly influences which networks are discovered and how reliably.

**üíª Basic Aircrack-ng Workflow**

Step-by-step commands used in this project:

**1. Identify Wi-Fi interfaces**

iwconfig


**2. Stop services that interfere with monitor mode:**

- sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager

- sudo systemctl stop wpa_supplicant


**3. Kill interfering processes and enable monitor mode:**

- sudo airmon-ng check kill

- sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

This creates a monitor-mode interface (e.g., wlan0mon).


**4. Scan for networks:**

- sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

Hidden networks will appear with ESSID set to <hidden> or <length:‚Ä¶>.


**5. Save results to CSV**
- sudo airodump-ng --output-format csv -w wifi_scan wlan0mon

üìä **Results**
A radar-style visualization was created from the captured .csv file.
    ‚Ä¢ Blue markers: Visible SSIDs
    ‚Ä¢ Red markers: Hidden SSIDs
    ‚Ä¢ Angle: Antenna pointing direction (0¬∞‚Äì180¬∞)
    ‚Ä¢ Radius: Signal strength (closer to center = stronger)
This representation makes it clear that hidden SSIDs can be found just as easily as visible ones, provided the antenna is directed toward the source.


üîê **Wi-Fi Security Notes**
Many people assume that hiding a network name adds protection. In practice:
    ‚Ä¢ Hidden SSIDs are still broadcast in management frames.
    ‚Ä¢ Client devices connecting to hidden SSIDs will leak the SSID in probe requests.
    ‚Ä¢ Attackers with basic tools can easily discover these networks.
    
‚úÖ **Stronger Wi-Fi Security Recommendations:**
    ‚Ä¢ Always use WPA2 or WPA3 with a strong passphrase (12+ random characters).
    ‚Ä¢ Disable outdated encryption (WEP, WPA1).
    ‚Ä¢ Regularly update router firmware to patch vulnerabilities.
    ‚Ä¢ Consider using guest networks or VLANs for IoT devices.
    ‚Ä¢ Reduce unnecessary transmit power to limit signal leakage outside your property.
Hiding an SSID is not harmful, but it provides no real security.
